    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Nothing but gruel.</p>

        
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup oatmeal or oat groats</li>
        <li>1 cup flaxseed meal</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped or ground walnuts</li>
        <li>1 cup oat bran</li>
        <li>4 cups milk (cow's milk, vanilla soy milk, almond milk, or other plant-based milk)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)</li>
        <li>Your own hair (optional)</li>
    </ul>

        
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook oatmeal (or groats) in 4 cups of boiling water for 5 minutes. You won't see much change in oatmeal consistency at this time.</li>
        <li>Simmer mixture on low heat for 45 minutes. You'll notice the oatmeal has soaked up water and formed a thick, cooked porridge-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Allow mixture to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Mix oatmeal/groat mixture with flaxseed meal, walnuts, and oat bran. Consistency will be very thick, almost like paste, at this time.</li>
        <li>Add milk in slowly using 1/4-cup increments.</li>
        <li>Adjust the amount of milk you add to reach desired consistency. For a thicker gruel, use 1/4 to 1/2 cup less (3 1/2 to 3 3/4 cups of milk total); for a runnier gruel, add 1/4 to 1/2 cups of additional milk (4 1/4 to 4 1/2 cups total).</li>
        <li>If you added too much milk, strain runny gruel if you want to eliminate excess liquid to thicken it up.</li>
        <li>The gruel can be served hot or cold. Heat gruel on your stovetop over low heat (while stirring) for 3 to 4 minutes to serve it hot. Chill gruel in the refrigerator for at least an hour if you want to serve it cold.</li>
        <li>Top with cinnamon, if desired, before serving.</li>
    </ol>
