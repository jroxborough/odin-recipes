    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>We gonna have some tuna for dinner?</p>

        
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pouches (5 ounces each) albacore white tuna in water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>8 slices whole wheat bread, toasted if desired</li>
        <li>4 slices Muenster or provolone cheese</li>
        <li>1 medium ripe avocado, peeled and sliced</li>
    </ul>

        
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook oatmeal (or groats) in 4 cups of boiling water for 5 minutes. You won't see much change in oatmeal consistency at this time.</li>
        <li>Simmer mixture on low heat for 45 minutes. You'll notice the oatmeal has soaked up water and formed a thick, cooked porridge-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Allow mixture to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Mix oatmeal/groat mixture with flaxseed meal, walnuts, and oat bran. Consistency will be very thick, almost like paste, at this time.</li>
        <li>Add milk in slowly using 1/4-cup increments.</li>
        <li>Adjust the amount of milk you add to reach desired consistency. For a thicker gruel, use 1/4 to 1/2 cup less (3 1/2 to 3 3/4 cups of milk total); for a runnier gruel, add 1/4 to 1/2 cups of additional milk (4 1/4 to 4 1/2 cups total).</li>
        <li>If you added too much milk, strain runny gruel if you want to eliminate excess liquid to thicken it up.</li>
        <li>The gruel can be served hot or cold. Heat gruel on your stovetop over low heat (while stirring) for 3 to 4 minutes to serve it hot. Chill gruel in the refrigerator for at least an hour if you want to serve it cold.</li>
        <li>Top with cinnamon, if desired, before serving.</li>
    </ol>
